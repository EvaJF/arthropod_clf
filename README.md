This repository contains the code of our arthropod classification project in a notebook format. 

The Arthropod dataset is available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/mistag/arthropod-taxonomy-orders-object-detection-dataset) and the IP102 dataset was graciously shared with us by Mr. Wu and his team. Their pretrained Resnet50 network is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/xpwu95/IP102).
